 - Friday, September 6th is our next Coffee & Conversation, from 8:00 - 8:30 Am
 - Rob Farabaugh will speak on Special Needs Planning and how to take care of children or adults with special needs and still not disqualify them for Government benefits. What are the mechanics of setting up a Special Needs Trust and how best to fund it?  How would this fit into your marketing plan?
 - We hope you will grab a cup of coffee & join us.
